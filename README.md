# Polytopia Damage Calculator

My first project doing Typescript and React.

Use "npm install", "npm run build" & "npm run start" before deploying react app to azure/firebase/hosting

If you would just like to run the app locally without deploying, you can set `isLocal = true` in `src/firebase.js`.

# Setup

For firebase hosting, configure your project API keys for src/firebase.js in .env.local file or disable firebase all together.

More details to get started are here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup and here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html.
